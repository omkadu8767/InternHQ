# CORS Fix for Render Deployment

## 🚨 Issue: CORS Error
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://internhq-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login' 
from origin 'https://internhq-frontend.onrender.com' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## ✅ Applied Fixes:

### 1. **Simplified CORS Configuration**
- Changed from restrictive origin checking to `origin: '*'` temporarily
- Added all necessary HTTP methods and headers
- Explicit preflight request handling

### 2. **Additional CORS Headers**
- Added manual CORS headers as middleware backup
- Ensures all requests get proper CORS headers

### 3. **Environment Variable Fix**
- Removed trailing slash from `FRONTEND_URL`
- Updated from `https://internhq-frontend.onrender.com/` to `https://internhq-frontend.onrender.com`

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

1. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for production"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy Backend on Render:**
   - Go to your backend service on Render
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

3. **Test the Fix:**
   - Try logging in from your frontend
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Backend logs should show requests coming through

## 🔍 Verification:

### Backend Health Check:
Visit: `https://internhq-backend.onrender.com/health`
Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","cors":"enabled"}`

### CORS Headers Test:
Check browser Network tab for these headers in responses:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Content-Length, X-Requested-With, auth-token`

## 🔒 Security Note:
The current fix uses `origin: '*'` which allows all origins for immediate debugging. 
After confirming it works, you can restrict it back to specific domains:

```javascript
origin: ['https://internhq-frontend.onrender.com']
```

## 🎯 Expected Result:
- ✅ No more CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ API calls from frontend work successfully  
- ✅ Login/signup functionality restored
